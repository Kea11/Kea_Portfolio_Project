                        <h5>My coding journey</h5>
                        <p>
                            My journey had humble beginnings, I started out at Harambe - a job placement company - where I was asked to write a number of tests to assess my aptitude. I excelled in the data-science tests and I was told about an opportunity at the African Developers Academy - where I could learn how to code. I was invited to a games day at ADA, where we were put into teams and given the challenge to create our own game. It was an interesting and fun experience, but I had no idea how well I had done, until I was contacted by ADA and told that I had been selected to be a part of a weekend long bootcamp. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the bootcamp, we were introduced to a novel coding platform called Turtle Academy, where we used the Turtle coding language (somewhat similar to CSS and JavaScript combined) to build shapes and patterns. At first it was simple, but soon we were creating our own algorithms to randomly generate patterns as well as draw out our own artwork. I found this stimulating and interesting, and I was excited to learn more. That’s why, when I was contacted by ADA again, I was over the moon. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I became one of the 12 students selected to be a part of the year long program where we were told that we would become front-end developers. I knew absolutely nothing about coding, and when HTML was first introduced I thought to myself, “What did I get myself into?” HTML seemed scary but I got the hang of it and when CSS was introduced, I was so terrified. But soon I was experimenting with colours, animations and shapes - and the world of front-end development suddenly became a wonderland of possibilities. Then we were hit with another challenge - JavaScript. This language gave me sleepless nights and at the time I was a bundle of stress. But I learned that with time, patience and perseverance I could code in this language and do seemingly impossible tasks. I would say that JavaScript was the most challenging, but it has left me wanting more. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As we were nearing the exciting prospect of our 2 month internships, Covid-19 was declared a pandemic and the President of South Africa called for a national lockdown. All of a sudden ADA was closed and I had to continue learning at home - facing frequent power outages and limited data. On my phone I continued revising what I had learned using Free Code Camp, all the while waiting for news on what would happen with our studies. I was living on the hope that the program would start up again and that I could continue learning and growing in this field.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally we were allowed back at school, with one month left to complete our studies and get our certificates. I knew that I still had a lot to learn and I am hoping to continue growing and succeeding.
